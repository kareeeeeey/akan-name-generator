          <p class="description">
            The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the
            day of the week they were born and the order in which they were
            born. These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to
            Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their
            soul. The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul.
            The well thought and organized naming system of the Akan's was
            initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many people's
            attention as they desire to know more about these names. As a matter
            of fact, it is possible to tell what led to someone's birth, the day
            they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their
            names.

                  In Arabic, the female name Hanan translates as "compassion",
                  "tenderness", "benevolence" or "sweet". The term "hanan" means
                  "merciful" in Hebrews. As a result, she rarely manages to
                  build a busy social life. This intelligent woman often shows a
                  predisposition for the strange and irrational. She likes to
                  show her originality through her clothing choices and
                  attitude.
